### My Vision

Alan Gleske started his business with a **vision to promote forestry
management** in a way that allowed landowners to trust who they utilize to
harvest their timber.  He practices being a good steward to the land by
conducting the operation in a way that will promote the future health and
profitability of the stand to come.  Through his Bachelor of Science in Forestry
with a major in Forest Resources Management earned at West Virginia University,
he has the education and tools to look at a forested area, and tailor a plan
that aligns with the landowner’s objectives with the mindset to keep costs low
and profitability high for future generations to come.

### My Education

> I graduated from
>
> **WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY**, Morgantown, WV 26506.<br />
> _Bachelor of Science in Forestry with a major in Forest Resources Management_.
>
> Course work specializing in: harvesting forest products, forest resources
> management, forestry economics, silvicultural systems, forest mensuration, and
> forest ecology.

While at WVU, Alan worked at the University’s research forest where his **passion
for logging initially began**.  Upon graduating, Alan spent three fire seasons,
May to October, in Happy Camp, CA fighting wildfires.  During the off season
Alan spent his time working for a small family run, yet highly mechanized
logging operation learning how to navigate complex harvests techniques and
merchandising constraints.  

### My Dream Job

In 2018, Alan began his own adventure **taking flight to his dreams by launching
Appalachian Growth Logging, LLC**.  Since then, the demand for additional
services utilizing the revenue streams from timber harvesting arose such as:
invasive species control and thinning in overstocked timber stands to promote
forest growth and vigor.

Having the tools to do so Alan launched the second business, Appalachian Growth
Forest Management, LLC. With both businesses established, this opened the
umbrella to combine both businesses under one core entity named Appalachian
Growth Forestry.  Alan is licensed, certified, and insured in forest pest
control through the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
(VDACS) Office of Pesticide Services and a Certified Prescribed Burn Manager
through the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF). Prescribed fire is another
useful and cost effective tool in promoting an overall healthy, managed forest
by which Alan is well versed in through his western and local wildland fire
experiences.
