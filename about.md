Forest fires provide an important role to the ecosystem.  It resets a plot of
land; clearing out the under brush which helps promote new growth for saplings
and buds.  Basically, forest fires clear out the unhealthy plants in order to
allow healthier plants to replace them.  Land owners can emulate a controlled
forest fire by hiring a professional.

burning is a cost effective tool to accomplish objectives in your woodlot.  From
backyard bonfires reducing vegetation in and around your home to full scale
property burning to promote native grasses, help control invasive species,
